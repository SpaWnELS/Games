# Pygomania
## The origin of the game
After playing Iron Snout, we (MartinWho2 and eliot-portevin) decided to create a similar game to improve our python skills. To give credit where is due, MartinWho2 ended up doing all the programming after two weeks or so, since eliot-portevin found better things to do.

## The game

The game is a 1v1 online fight game like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat in a pixel art style composed of 6 different characters. Of course, each character has his own attacks and ultimates...

## The characters

- The Mage 
- The Boxer
- The Dwarf
- The URSS Soldier
- The Gorgone
- The tenniswoman

## Installation of the game 

If you don't have Python and Git installed on your machine, make sure you do that before going on with the next steps. Following up is the standard procedure for repository cloning:

Go into your terminal (cmd) and type 
```
cd {The repository where you want to put the game} 
git clone https://github.com/eliot-portevin/Pygomania
```

Please do note that coming from the canton of Vaud may cause this process to crash inexpectedly, since this repository was designed to be used by cool people and cool people only.

## Play

To play, you need at first to launch the program server.py, as my server is not yet installed and the launch the main.py program.
When the game will be finished you'll just have to launch the main.py program and it will be done.
